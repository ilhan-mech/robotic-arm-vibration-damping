# Design Reflections

During the simulations, I approached the system as if testing a physical instrument.
Observations were noted in a laboratory-style manner and later summarized here.

## Damping vs responsiveness
Increasing damping reduced overshoot and oscillations but also slowed the response.
This tradeoff became especially clear when comparing free response simulations.

## Frequency sensitivity
The forced vibration studies showed that system behavior depends strongly on the excitation frequency relative to the natural frequency.
This reinforced the importance of avoiding resonance in surgical systems.

## Control actions
Derivative action significantly improved vibration suppression.
PID control improved steady-state accuracy but introduced tuning challenges.

## Next steps
- Transfer the model to Simulink
- Compare time-domain responses between MATLAB and Simulink
